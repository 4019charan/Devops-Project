# CI/CD - Project 
Implemented a simple CI/CD Pipeline for an calculator app.

# Goal
To Establish a Robust and Reliable Development process by setting up version control using Git, implementing comprehensive Unit Tests, and setting up effective workflows to ensure that only properly tested code is merged from other branches into the Master branch.

## Requirements

<br> Link to setup Python 3.9 - https://www.python.org/downloads/ </br>
<br> Link to setup Git the first time - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup </br>
<br> Use a Editor of your choice </br>
<br> Link to get pip3 - https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ </br>



## Future Scope Recommendations - 
<br> Now that the initial code is in place, it's time to focus on improving its quality. One way to do this is to add more checks such as linters, code coverage, and code quality checks. </br>
<br> Another recommended step is to add 'runs on' actions like a pull request. This allows for a more streamlined workflow and can help ensure that the code changes are thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch. </br>
